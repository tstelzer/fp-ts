# Typed functional programming with fp-ts

In this series of tutorials you will be introduced to typed functional
programming using fp-ts. If you just discovered functional programming, and
want to start from scratch, have a look at [the road to composition](/tutorials/the-road-to-composition)  where
you will get a practical introduction, no prior knowledge required. If you've
already built an intuition and want to dive deeper, learn about [functional
design](/tutorials/functional-design). Are you a seasoned practitioner, or just interested in the theory
behind it all? Check out the [introduction to typeclasses](/tutorials/introduction-to-typeclasses).
