# Introduction to functional programming with fp-ts

In this series of tutorials you will be introduced to functional programming.
You should already have an solid understanding of programming, JavaScript and
at least superficial knowledge of TypeScript. We're trying to keep this series
as practical as possible, no mathematical background required. If you _do_
want to deep-dive into the theory, we've got you covered in that section of the
documentation.

To get the most out of these tutorials, feel free to code along and test for
yourself.
