# Introduction

[In](In) this introductory series of tutorials you will learn about function
composition and related concepts like partial application and curring, all
of which will help you to combine small and simple functions into programs,
while preserving simplicity and expressivity.

Later tutorials will build on top of the skills you will learn here. Every
tutorial will focus on one major concept and will show how to implement it
using `fp-ts`. Though we will make heavy use of the extensive toolkit of
`fp-ts`, all of the concepts you will learn here are entirely transferable
between languages. Functional programming is essentially the same, regardless
of if you are using TypeScript, F#, Haskell or Scala. Even non-functional
languages have adopted many of these concepts in recent years.

To have a common thread through this series, we'll build a simple program that
takes some user data and transforms it in various ways.

To get the most out of these tutorials, feel free to code along and test for
yourself.
